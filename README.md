**About Me
After engaging with the Effective Altruism community, I made the leap from Care Work to Software Development. Driven by my passion for logic and technology, I believe in tech's incredible potential to positively impact lives. I'm an avid tech learner who aspires to write clean code.

**Main Projects**

| Role          | Project Name                     | Technologies Used                    | Description                                                                                                     | Repository                                         |

| Solo project  | [JustCarrot.co.uk](https://justcarrot.co.uk) | JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, HTML, CSS | A technology I created to help users with habit change. Users set themselves a goal with a time limit and incentivize themselves with money. If they succeed, they get their money back; otherwise, it's donated to an effective charity. | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChristieGriffiths/Just-Carrot) |
| Group project | [Battle Tetris](https://michael-szczepanski.itch.io/battle-tetris) | JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jest          | A two-player Tetris game developed from scratch. I implemented real-time gameplay and created the logic that defined when a player had won the game.                    | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChristieGriffiths/Tetris)      |

**Coding**

**Makers Coding Bootcamp (March 2023 - Jul 2023)**  
- Built a replica of Facebook using JavaScript with MongoDB - a two-week-long group project.
- Built a replica of Twitter from scratch using Ruby with a PostgreSQL DB - a week-long group project.
- Used GitHub in a group setting where we became accustomed to having multiple branches, pull requests, and merge conflicts.
- OOD (Object-Oriented Design): Began to familiarise myself with object-oriented programming principles, enabling me to write clean, organised, and maintainable code.
- Collaborated & communicated effectively in team environments to deliver projects utilsing agile methodoligies that involved standups, planning sessions, and sprints. 
- Used TDD to create all our projects - it was an invaluable insurance policy for our code. I’m a big fan of TDD because without it it seems analogous to rock climbing without a rope.
- Pair Programming: For 3 months, spent half the day pair programming. This accelerated my learning as it helped reinforce the things I already knew by explaining them to my partner when they were confused and when I was confused I’d often be clarified much sooner than would have been had I been on my own. It also improved my ability to verbalise what I thought my code was doing and why - which is a key part of software development as a team.
