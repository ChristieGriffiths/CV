**About Me**

After engaging with the Effective Altruism community, I made the leap from Care Work to Software Development. Driven by my passion for logic and technology, I believe in tech's incredible potential to positively impact lives. I'm an avid tech learner who aspires to write clean code—I can't wait to get my first job as a Junior Developer!

| Solo project  | [JustCarrot.co.uk](https://justcarrot.co.uk) | JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React, Node, HTML, CSS | A technology I created to help users with habit change. Users set themselves a goal with a time limit and incentivize themselves with money. If they succeed, they get their money back; otherwise, it's donated to an effective charity. | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChristieGriffiths/Just-Carrot) |
