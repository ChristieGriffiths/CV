## About Me

After engaging with the Effective Altruism community, I made the leap from Care Work to Software Development. Driven by my passion for logic and technology, I believe in tech's incredible potential to positively impact lives. I'm an avid tech learner who aspires to write clean code—I can't wait to get my first job as a Junior Developer!
